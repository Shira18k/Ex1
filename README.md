Ex1- in this projact we were required to write functions that doing some operations on nummbers in diffrant bases.
Initially, the user need to imput a 2 numbers (num1 & num2) in the format of (numvalue b [2,16]) and for it the program printing if the format is true, it will add the value in base 10. else printing false and the value -1.
after that, the user asked to put a baes between 2 to 16. and the program do conversion for the numbers (num1 & num2) with tne new base- give the sum of connection between them and of the multiplication between them.
at final, the program printing for array that contain all numbers that accepted (num1, num2, num1+num2, num1*num2) -the max index that containing the max value.
